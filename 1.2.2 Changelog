v1.2.2:
Changes:

Upgraded:
- Forge to v14.23.5.2823

Known Issues:
- AE2 Stuff Advanced Inscribers not working as intended anymore, won't receive power. Use regular inscribers. AE2 Stuff needs an update badly (they haven't updated since 10/17)
- EnderIO ME Conduits (for ae2) don't directly connect to machines with input/export/etc blocks.  Use 1 regular fluix cable to connect initially, then you can run conduit off that.
- Mekanism still doesn't show some physical items in the world, but it still works
- Wheat and Barley seeds placed in a Farmer machine creates Natura cotton, I have zero clue why this is happening.

Important Mod Updates:
 -Fixed Thaumcraft quest tree rewards to be actually claimable
- Woot now spawns the next tier "crystals" so you don't actually need 36 blaze rods for a Tier 2 factory (for example).  Makes factories a LOT easier to deal with.

Removed:
- Deconstruction Table (not working as intended)

Configuration Changes:
- Added recipe to create AE2 cable anchors (for facades)
- Added recipe to make and cook End Stone
- All hoes can till soul sand
- Allowed Diamond Armor to be craftable again for Draconium Armor
- Allowed Robosurgeon to be craftable
- Changed NetherEx config to use Lava to moist soil instead of Ichor
- Changed Wireless Network Terminal to use old method instead (no charges)
- Created recipe for AE2 Network Tool (was missing, needed for Wireless Tool)
- Disabled Abaias from spawning (very massive, very spammy)
- Disabled Triffids from spawning (farmers rejoice!)
- Halved the spawn rate for Geonachs
- Remade Net and Dense Net recipes to be actually working
