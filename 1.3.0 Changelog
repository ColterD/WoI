Overview:
The Multiplayer Update!
Complete overhaul of the progression system to include game stages.
Hunting and mining dimensions merged with The Beneath mod.
Added content from minecraft patches up to 1.16 with Future MC mod.
FPS improvement when tabbed-out or idle with FPS Reducer.

LycanitesMobs removed just due to the continued trouble of developing with it and replaced with other (better) mods.
Better Diving removed, in the end, I was only using it for its underwater mechanic and for nothing else; seemed a waste.
GottschCore removed mostly because it just isn't needed anymore but also due to an incompatibility with Corail Tombstone.
Plus-TiC removed due to the author sabotaging his own code.  See mroe here: https://tinyurl.com/y9e92nkj
